## Preface

This repository contains the
[`cookiecutter`](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
template for generating a repository that provides boilerplates touching
on the differing components of an end-to-end ML project. This template
is dedicated for the GCP environment.

## Usage

To use the template and create a repository, you would need to
[install the `cookiecutter` CLI](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)
, say within a virtual environment and pass the URL of this template as
an argument, like such:

```bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/aimakerspace/ml-project-cookiecutter-gcp
```

You will then be prompted to provide inputs.These inputs will be used to
populate different parts of the repository to be generated by
`cookiecutter`.
